Goal: 
Create a visulization and planning tool for energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions at buildings in Washington, DC 

Introduction: 
- In large scale, buildings consume about 40% of world energy and generate about 40% of world Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission.
- State and local authorities are planning to minimize their carbon footprint toward reaching net zero carbon urban environment.  

Description: 
- My goal is to provide an energy and carbon map of buildings in Washington, DC that shows building performance by building types such as office, hospital, and residential.
- In addition, this tool can be used to set targets for building GHG emissions such as 30% reductions by 2030. 
- This tool would recommend a mix of two measures depending on the user input, including building energy efficiency rebates, and renewable power purchase.
- The tool would select the best candidates of buildings that the city can provide rebates for energy improvement. Morover, 
- Energy effieicncy rebates are incentives that set the amount of payment relative to the improvement in building energy or GHG performance. The effort to find the cost-effective measures to reduce energy or GHG would be per building owner and would differ by building type.
- Renewable energy purchase can be made at building level or utility level.
- Based on the unit cost of purchasing renewable energy and efficiency rebates entered by the user, the tool can provide the optimum combination of the two measures.

Developer background:
- I'm Saber Nikkho, currently a mechanical engineer and building performance consultant at Affiliated Engineers, Inc. in Rockville, MD. I design building HVAC systems and simulate building performance for green building ratings. My background is in Mechanical Engineering and my research has been in building energy simulation and HVAC design. I hold a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park. I have worked with building performance data, metered and simulated, on various scales from individual building to building clusters for the past 7 years.

Summary:
Visualize building energy and GHG intensities per building type
Planner tool: set goals for GHG reductions using a mix of energy efficiency rebates and renewable power purchase
