State and local authorities are planning to minimize their carbon footprint toward reaching net zero carbon urban environment. In large scale, buildings consume about 40% of world energy and generate about 40% of world carbon. My goal is to provide an energy and carbon map of buildings in Washington, DC that can be used for city energy planners and city residents to track and plan future building performance across the district. This energy and carbon map would use current public data of buildings, the energy performance and carbon footprint. The project would categorize building types, and color code buildings and district wards based on their energy use and carbon densities per area. Local authorities would be able to see the buildings and wards with highest energy use intensity. Therefore, the tool would recommend areas with highest return for rebates for energy retrofit of buildings. Moreover, the tool can estimate the energy and carbon footprint of a future building(s) based on building type and square footage. This way, local authorities can track future energy and carbon footprint of the district.
